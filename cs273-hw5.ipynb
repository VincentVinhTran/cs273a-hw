    "\n",
    "This homework (and subsequent ones) will involve data analysis and reporting on methods and results\n",
    "using Python code. You will submit a **single PDF file** that contains everything to Gradescope. This includes any text you wish to include to describe your results, the complete code snippets of how you attempted each problem, any figures that were generated, and scans of any work on paper that you wish to include. It is important that you include enough detail that we know how you solved the problem, since otherwise we will be unable to grade it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your homeworks will be given to you as Jupyter notebooks containing the problem descriptions and some template code that will help you get started. You are encouraged to use these starter Jupyter notebooks to complete your assignment and to write your report. This will help you not only ensure that all of the code for the solutions is included, but also will provide an easy way to export your results to a PDF file (for example, doing *print preview* and *printing to pdf*). I recommend liberal use of Markdown cells to create headers for each problem and sub-problem, explaining your implementation/answers, and including any mathematical equations. For parts of the homework you do on paper, scan it in such that it is legible (there are a number of free Android/iOS scanning apps, if you do not have access to a scanner), and include it as an image in the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Double check that all of your answers are legible on Gradescope, e.g. make sure any text you have written does not get cut off.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions/concerns about using Jupyter notebooks, ask us on EdD. If you decide not to use Jupyter notebooks, but go with Microsoft Word or LaTeX to create your PDF file, make sure that all of the answers can be generated from the code snippets included in the document.\n",

    "Random Forests are bagged collections of decision trees, which select their decision nodes from randomly chosen subsets of the possible features (rather than all features).  You can implement this easily in ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` using option ``max_features=n``, where ``n`` is the number of features to select from. Since you have ~ 14 features, you might choose, say, ``n=10``; smaller values of ``n`` will make each tree more random, but may require you to have a high maximum depth to ensure you still fit the data effectively.\n",

    "For your individual learners, use parameters that will not constrain the complexity of the resulting tree very much  (e.g., set your depth cutoff >= 15, min leaf 1-4, etc.), since the bagging will be used to control overfitting instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will implement bootstrap sampling yourself (again, see pseudocode); simply generate $m'$ data indices uniformly with replacement, using ``numpy`` functions or simply ``rand`` and conversion to integers.\n",
